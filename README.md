## Corpus information

This is the ParlamentParla speech corpus for Catalan. The audio segments were
extracted from recordings the Catalan Parliament Catalan Parliament 
([Parlament de Catalunya](https://www.parlament.cat/)) plenary sessions. We
aligned the transcriptions with the recordings and extracted the corpus. 
The content belongs to the Catalan Parliament and the data is 
released conforming their [terms
of use](https://www.parlament.cat/pcat/serveis-parlament/avis-legal/).

Preparation of this corpus was partly supported by the [Department of
Culture](http://cultura.gencat.cat/) of the Catalan autonomous government,
and the v2.0 was supported by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, within
the framework of the project [AINA](http://aina.gencat.cat/) of the 
[Departament de Pol√≠tiques Digitals](https://politiquesdigitals.gencat.cat).

As of v2.0 the corpus is separated into 211 hours of clean and 400 hours of
other quality segments. The stat details are as follows:
